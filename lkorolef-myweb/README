For my source files I have 4: client.cpp, log.cpp, parse.cpp, and main.cpp. These are found in the "/src" directory.
 - Client.cpp is where all client/server connections, port initialization, and message exchanges occur. Here we have the
majority of code/logic when recieving a response from the server. 
 - Log.cpp is intended to seperate all file writing away from other source files. It's purpose is to write to (and in some scenerios create) our output.dat file when called apon. 
 - Parse.cpp is where our regex parsing occurs. Calling on a simple function to parse a string (intended for the command line arguments) and directly interact with a vector that is passed to the parameter.
 - Main.cpp is self explanatory, it contains the collection of functions to operate and maintain the client interaction with the server and all appropriate error heirarchy responses.

The header files are all respective to the source files. These are found in the "/include" directory.

The build files are all respective to the source files. These are found in the "/build" directory.

The executable and output.dat file are found in the "/bin" directory.

The documentation on test cases and such is found in the "/doc" directory.

Makefile is my Makefile.
